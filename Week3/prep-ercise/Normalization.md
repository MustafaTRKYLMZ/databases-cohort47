Week 3 Exercise

Last week you created an ERD for the database for storing food recipes. How can you normalize your database based on what you learned this week? In particular, try answering following questions and provide table definitions from the last week and this week to explain the changes.

Was your database already in 2NF / 3 NF?
Yes, I checked again. It is 2NF/3F.

What changes did you have to do to normalize your database?

It looked again and normalized.To ensure this, I verified that each attribute is single-valued and every column has unique names. Additionally, I addressed both partial and transitive dependencies by decomposing single tables  into two separate tables.
